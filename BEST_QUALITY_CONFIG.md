### Example Difference:

**Base Model (250M params, 512 tokens):**
> "Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance."

**Large Model (783M params, 1024 tokens):**
> "Remote sensing is a sophisticated technology and scientific discipline that involves the acquisition of information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites. This process works by detecting and measuring reflected or emitted radiation without making physical contact with the subject.
>
> The technology encompasses several key components: sensors that capture electromagnetic radiation, platforms (such as satellites or drones) that carry these sensors, and sophisticated data processing systems that interpret the collected information. Remote sensing can operate across various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, infrared, and microwave frequencies.
>
> Applications include environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture management, disaster assessment, and climate change research. The data collected enables scientists and decision-makers to analyze large-scale phenomena, track changes over time, and make informed decisions about resource management and environmental protection."
