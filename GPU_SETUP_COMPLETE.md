## 🎮 GPU Monitoring

### Check GPU Usage While Running:

Open another terminal and run:
```powershell
nvidia-smi -l 1
```

You'll see:
- GPU utilization spike when answering questions
- Memory usage increase during inference
- Temperature and power draw

### Expected GPU Stats During Use:
- **GPU Utilization**: 80-95%
- **Memory Used**: 2-3 GB
- **Temperature**: 50-70°C
- **Power Draw**: 40-60W

## 💡 Optimization Tips

### For Maximum Performance:

1. **Close Other GPU Apps**: 
   - Close games, video editors, or other GPU-intensive apps
   - This gives your chatbot full GPU access

2. **Monitor Temperature**:
   - GPU will heat up during use
   - Laptop fans may spin faster (normal!)
   - RTX 4060 can handle it easily

3. **Batch Questions**:
   - First question loads model to GPU (~1 sec)
   - Subsequent questions are instant

4. **Keep Laptop Plugged In**:
   - GPU uses more power
   - Battery mode may throttle performance

## 🔧 Verification

### How to Confirm GPU is Being Used:

When you start the chatbot, look for these messages:
```
Using device for embeddings: cuda
🎮 Using device for model: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU
✅ Model loaded on GPU - expect 10-20x faster responses!
```

If you see these, **GPU acceleration is working!** 🎉

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If GPU isn't being used:

1. Check CUDA installation:
   ```powershell
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
   ```
   Should print: `True`

2. Check GPU driver:
   ```powershell
   nvidia-smi
   ```
   Should show your RTX 4060

3. Restart chatbot after changes

### If you get CUDA errors:
- Make sure laptop is plugged in
- Close other GPU applications
- Restart VS Code/terminal
- Update NVIDIA drivers if needed
